    <!-- 
    - Developed an AI-powered interface tailored for designers, revolutionizing their creative process by overcoming creative blocks through cutting-edge algorithms such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
    - The interface generates novel designs with each click, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques.
    - The interface is powered by a GAN model trained on a dataset of 1.5 million images from the web.
    - It is a web-based tool that allows users to create interfaces for their applications.

    - For this project, I have been trying and optimizing GPU allocation and minimized computational requirements to enhance performance, ensuring seam-less operations of the system.
    - Explored opportunities to integrate the model into web3 technology, leading the way for decentralized and distributed implementation -->
