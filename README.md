Hello World, I'm Creative Technologist. 
My curiosity and passion are for solving computational and environmental challenges.  

I have a strong background in web development and design, as well as a deep understanding of the latest web technologies and trends.



## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª 8 YEARS of Experience in Designing & Developing Digital and Physical Products. 

### Creative Technologist and Owner
**[Radical Sphere](https://www.RadicalSphere.com/)** | Pune, India | 2015 - Present

1. Design User Experience and User Interface for Web and Mobile Applications.
2. Research and Develop new technologies and tools.
3. Optimizing GPU allocation and minimized computational requirements to enhance performance, ensuring seam-less operations of the Ai system.



#### **Projects**
1. **[Radical <‚Ä¢> Sphere](https://www.RadicalSphere.com/)** Developing an AI-powered interface tailored for designers, revolutionizing their creative process by overcoming creative blocks through cutting-edge algorithms such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

2. **Bottle Regeneration Ai model** The project started with a challenge of creating 1000 novel bottle design for water packaging company 'AquaAwareness'. We develop an Ai model trained on 500 bottles img dataset and successfully deployed on Google Colab. It took 3 months of research and several white papers to solve such Ai challenges. The project experience is now been implemented in developing Radical Sphere an ai powered image generative designing tool.

3. üå© üñ® üè≠ **[Cloud Printing Factory](https://www.cloudprintingfactory.com/)** connects users to multiple printing technologies and services. 
How it works?
   1. Upload Design 
   2. Colaborate with Printer 
   3. Get Delivered at your doorstep. 

4. üêï **[Findoma.in](https://www.findoma.in/)** is a domain registrar website. It allows users to register domains and manage their DNS records.

5. üó∫ **[Extended Maps](https://www.instagram.com/extendedmaps/)** is an Instagram page that I created to share my passion for maps and data visualization. I post maps and data visualizations that I find interesting, and I also create my own maps and data visualizations.

6. üßÆ **[MathBoard]()** is an iOS  calculator keyboard app. The problem of app switching between texting and calculating has been solved with MathBoard App. An iOS keyboard interface has been designed to calculate while texting.

7. üöñ **Safar Car Rental** is a peer 2 peer cab/taxi booking network. Powered by Ai language model integrations 



#### **Client's Projects**
1. **[Kanso Design Works](https://kansodesignworks.co/)** is a UIUX Designer portfolio website built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

2. üè© **[Hiranya Resorts](https://www.hiranyaresorts.com/):** The goals of this website was to present Hiranya Resort attractively and engagingly. It was built using WIX.

3. **[Madhav Irrigation](https://radicalrohit.github.io/Madhav-Irrigation)** is a e-commerce project to represents 100+ irrigation products and create company's digital presence. It was build using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript. Provide product data was cleaned, segregated and stored in JSON format.

4. **[Environ Propacks](https://environ-propack.web.app)** are packaging products trader who wanted to take their game at an international level. I assisted them with building digital brand, UIUX and website. Conversation rate and trust has been improved exponentially.


## üõ† Skills
- **Programming Languages:** C, Python, JavaScript, PHP, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, JSON, Solidity 
- **Frameworks:** d3js, p5js, web3js OpenCV, OpenGL, React, Nodejs, Django, Flask, Bootstrap, jQuery.
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, GraphQL, 
- **Design Tools:** Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe PhotoShop, Affinity Designer, Affinity Photos, Blender.


## üéì Education

### Master in Computer Application MCA
From MIT, India | 2013 - 2015 

#### Subjects I enjoyed the most:
  1. Artificial Intelligence
  2. Cryptography
  3. Data Mining and Warehousing
  4. Data Structure and Algorithm
  5. Web Designing and Development
  6. Image Processing and GIS for Remote Sensing
  7. Design Patterns and Software Architecture

#### Project:
  1. **Google Cardboard:** The Google Cardboard project was an immersive virtual reality experience that aimed to make VR accessible and affordable for everyone. Utilizing a simple cardboard viewer and a smartphone, users could step into a virtual world and explore a variety of captivating environments.
  2. **FIFA Player Impact Engine:** The FIFA Player Impact Engine project was a groundbreaking initiative aimed at revolutionizing the realism and physics of player interactions within the FIFA video game series. It sought to create a more authentic and dynamic experience by accurately simulating the collisions, reactions, and physical interactions between players on the virtual soccer field.



### Bachelor in Computer Science B.Sc.(CS)
From Vivekananda College, MH, India | 2010 - 2013

    <!-- 
    - Developed an AI-powered interface tailored for designers, revolutionizing their creative process by overcoming creative blocks through cutting-edge algorithms such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
    - The interface generates novel designs with each click, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques.
    - The interface is powered by a GAN model trained on a dataset of 1.5 million images from the web.
    - It is a web-based tool that allows users to create interfaces for their applications.

    - For this project, I have been trying and optimizing GPU allocation and minimized computational requirements to enhance performance, ensuring seam-less operations of the system.
    - Explored opportunities to integrate the model into web3 technology, leading the way for decentralized and distributed implementation -->
