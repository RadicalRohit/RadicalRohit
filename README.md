## **Projects**


<!--
**[Radical [‚Ä¢] Sphere](https://www.RadicalSphere.com/)** Developing an AI-powered interface tailored for designers, revolutionizing their creative process by overcoming creative blocks through cutting-edge algorithms such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

**Bottle Regeneration Ai model** The project started with a challenge of creating 10,000 novel bottle design for water packaging company. We trained Ai model using 500  images of bottles on Google Colab. The project experience is now been implemented in developing Radical Sphere an Ai  image generative designing tool.

    - Developed an AI-powered interface tailored for designers, revolutionizing their creative process by overcoming creative blocks through cutting-edge algorithms such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
    - The interface generates novel designs with each click, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques.
    - The interface is powered by a GAN model trained on a dataset of 1.5 million images from the web.
    - It is a web-based tool that allows users to create interfaces for their applications.

    - For this project, I have been trying and optimizing GPU allocation and minimized computational requirements to enhance performance, ensuring seam-less operations of the system.
    - Explored opportunities to integrate the model into web3 technology, leading the way for decentralized and distributed implementation -->
